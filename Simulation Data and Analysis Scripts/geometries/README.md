# Geometries

This folder contains the geometry files used in the simulations. They are stored in hdf5-files, with one file specifying one geometry. The files named U1_R\*.h5 are idealized geometries used for model validation and exploration. The files named U1_G\*.h5 are based on dSTORM imaging.

The geometries can be visualized using the visualize_geometry.py script.
