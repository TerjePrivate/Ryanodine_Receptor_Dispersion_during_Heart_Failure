# Data

This folder contains the data from the simulations. Each stochastic simulation produces a hdf5 file, all the simulations that were included in the analysis have been bundleded as a tarball found in /raw/. The /pickles/ folder contains pickled pandas dataframes of some data extracted from the raw hdf5 files, made for simplicity of use. These pickles are made by the convert_to_dataframe.py script.
